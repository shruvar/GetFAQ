            <p>
                Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. Typing refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a strongly-typed language, such as Python, "1" + 2  will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for "type-coercion". 

<br>Type-checking can be done at two stages:

<br> • Static - Data Types are checked before execution. 

<br> • Dynamic - Data Types are checked during execution. 

Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.

                    An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages. Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step.

                        Yes, runtime errors exist in Python. For example, if you are duck typing and things look like a duck, then it is considered as a duck even if that is just a flag or stamp or any other thing. The code, in this case, would be A Run-time error. For example, Print “Hackr io”, then the runtime error would be the missing parenthesis that is required by print ( ).

                        In the case of dynamic loading, the process of compilation and linking depends on the style that is provided with the concerned system. In order to provide dynamic loading of the configuration setup files and rebuilding the interpreter, the Python interpreter is used.

                        The Pickle module in Python allows accepting any object and then converting it into a string representation. It then dumps the same into a file by means of the dump function. This process is known as pickling. 

                        The reverse process of pickling is known as unpickling i.e. retrieving original Python objects from a stored string representation.

                        Upon exiting, Python’s built-in effective cleanup mechanism comes into play and try to deallocate or destroy every other object. 

                        However, Python modules that are having circular references to other objects or the objects that are referenced from the global namespaces aren’t always deallocated or destroyed. 
                        
                        This is because it is not possible to deallocate those portions of the memory that are reserved by the C library.

                        Decorators are used to add some design patterns to a function without changing its structure. Decorators generally are defined before the function they are enhancing. To apply a decorator we first define the decorator function. Then we write the function it is applied to and simply add the decorator function above the function it has to be applied to. For this, we use the @ symbol before the decorator.

                        Slicing is used to access parts of sequences like lists, tuples, and strings. The syntax of slicing is-[start:end:step]. The step can be omitted as well. When we write [start:end] this returns all the elements of the sequence from the start (inclusive) till the end-1 element. If the start or end element is negative i, it means the ith element from the end. The step indicates the jump or how many elements have to be skipped. Eg. if there is a list- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Then [-1:2:2] will return elements starting from the last element till the third element by printing every second element.i.e. [8,6,4].

                        <br>There are 4 types of literals in python-
<br>•		String literals– A string literal is created by assigning some text enclosed in single or double quotes to a variable. To create multiline literals, assign the multiline text enclosed in triple quotes. Eg.name="Tanya"
<br>•		A character literals– It is created by assigning a single character enclosed in double quotes. Eg. a='T'
<br>•		Numeric literals– They include numeric values that can be either integer, floating point value, or a complex number. Eg. a=50
<br>•		Boolean literals– These can be 2 values- either True or False.

                        The dataframes in python can be combined in the following ways-
                        <br>•		Concatenating them by stacking the 2 dataframes vertically.
                        <br>•		Concatenating them by stacking the 2 dataframes horizontally.
                        <br>•		Combining them on a common column. This is referred to as joining.
The concat() function is used to concatenate two dataframes. Its syntax is- pd.concat([dataframe1, dataframe2]).

                        Memory is managed in Python in the following ways:
<br>•		Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead.
<br>•		The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
<br>•		Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.

                        If you’re new to web programming, Flask is a fantastic place to start. Many websites are built with Flask and receive a lot of traffic, although not as much as Django-based websites. If you want precise control, you should use flask, whereas a Django developer relies on a large community to produce unique websites.

                        A classifier is used to predict the class of any data point. Classifiers are special hypotheses that are used to assign class labels to any particular data points. A classifier often uses training data to understand the relation between input variables and the class. Classification is a method used in supervised learning in Machine Learning.

                        List comprehensions are used for transforming one list into another list. Elements can be conditionally included in the new list and each element can be transformed as needed. It consists of an expression leading a for clause, enclosed in brackets.

                        “with” statement in python is used in exception handling. A file can be opened and closed while executing a block of code, containing the “with” statement, without using the close() function. It essentially makes the code much more easy to read.

                        One major difference between a tuple and a dictionary is that dictionary is mutable while a tuple is not. Meaning the content of a dictionary can be changed without changing it’s identity, but in tuple that’s not possible.

        <h1>Top 5 Things to Remember in an Interview</h1>
        <p>You worked hard on your resume and job application, and now you are called in for an in-person job interview. You are one step closer to your dream job.

            It’s time to understand how to succeed in the job interview, so that you can actually land the job. Here are the most important things you have to remember.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="faq">

                    <h1>1. Dress appropriately</h1>

                    <h6>Plan out an outfit that fits the culture of the company you are applying for. If the company does not have a dress code, it’s a good idea to wear business casual.
                        
                        Leave your shorts and tank top at home, and put on a shirt and a pair of long pants. It’s always better to be overdressed than under. Try on your outfit before the interview to make sure that it fits and looks smart.
                    </h6>   
                    <h1>2. Arrive on time </h1>
                    <h6>Don’t ever arrive at a job interview late! It’s best to arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled time in case you have to fill in some paperwork. This also allows you to settle down and check out the dynamics of the office.
                        
                        If you are not familiar with the area in which the company is located, do a test run a week or two before to make sure that you won’t get lost. If you are driving, make a note on where you can park your car.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>3. Mind your manner</h1>
                    <h6>Be polite and greet everyone you meet, including people you meet in the elevator. When you enter the interview, offer the interviewer a warm greeting. These first few seconds can make or break your interview. At the end of the interview, don’t forget to thank the interviewer for giving you the opportunity for the meeting. When you leave the company, say goodbye to the receptionist.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>4. Pay attention to your body language<h1>
                    <h6>    Poor body language, such as playing with a pen, chewing gum, slouching, and even brushing back hair, can be a distraction. If you notice you have a tendency to do any of these, train yourself to avoid these bad habits. You can replace them with positive body language that include nodding, eye contact, smiling, and solid posture.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>5. Ask insightful questions</h1>
                    <h6>Most interviewers end an interview by allowing the candidate to ask questions. Regardless of how well you know the company and how thorough the interviewer in telling you about the job, you must ask a few questions. The more insightful your questions are, the more you will impress your interviewer.
