                The following are the types of data structures: 

<br>• Lists: A collection of related things linked to the previous or/and following data items. 

<br>• Records: A collection of fields, each of which contains data from a single data type. 

<br>• Trees: A data structure that organizes data in a hierarchical framework. This form of data structure follows the ordered order of data item insertion, deletion, and modification. 

<br>• Tables: The data is saved in the form of rows and columns. These are comparable to records in that the outcome or alteration of data is mirrored across the whole table.

                        A multidimensional array is a multidimensional array with more than one dimension. It is an array of arrays or an array with numerous layers. The 2D array, or two-dimensional array, is the most basic multidimensional array. As you'll see in the code, it's technically an array of arrays. A 2D array is also referred to as a matrix or a table with rows and columns. Declaring a multidimensional array is the same as saying a one-dimensional array. We need to notify C that we have two dimensions for a two-dimensional array.

                        A stack is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure, as in a real physical stack or piles where you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things. Thus, insertion (push) and deletion (pop) of items take place only at one end called top of the stack, with a particular order: LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

                        In this data structure interview question, you can also discuss your experience and situations using queue. A queue is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure or an ordered list, using the First In First Out (FIFO) operation to access elements. Insert operations can be performed only at one end called REAR and delete operations can be performed only at the other end called FRONT.

                        Asymptotic analysis is the technique of determining an algorithm's running time in mathematical units to determine the program's limits, also known as "run-time performance." The purpose is to identify the best case, worst case, and average-case times for completing a particular activity. While not a deep learning training technique, Asymptotic analysis is an essential diagnostic tool for programmers to analyze an algorithm's efficiency rather than its correctness.

                        Asymptotic Notation represents an algorithm's running time - how long an algorithm takes with a given input, n. Big O, large Theta (), and big Omega () are the three distinct notations. When the running time is the same in all circumstances, big- is used, big-O for the worst-case running time, and big- for the best case running time.

                        Quicksort is the name of a sorting algorithm. The method selects a pivot element and rearranges the array elements so that all items less than the pivot chosen element go to the left side of the pivot and all elements more significant than the pivot element move to the right side. 

Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm as well. The algorithm divides the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then combines the two sorted halves. The goal of points that are closest together is to identify the nearest pair of points in an x-y plane collection of points. The issue may be solved in O(n2) time by computing the distances between each pair of locations and comparing them to determine the shortest distance.

A queue is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure or an ordered list,  using the First In First Out (FIFO) operation to access elements. Insert operations can be performed only at one end called REAR and delete operations can be performed only at the other end called FRONT.

                        Asymptotic analysis is the technique of determining an algorithm's running time in mathematical units to determine the program's limits, also known as "run-time performance." The purpose is to identify the best case, worst case, and average-case times for completing a particular activity. While not a deep learning training technique, Asymptotic analysis is an essential diagnostic tool for programmers to analyze an algorithm's efficiency rather than its correctness.

                        Assuming that the data to be inserted is a unique value (that is, not an existing entry in the tree), check first if the tree is empty. If it’s empty, just insert the new item in the root node. If it’s not empty, refer to the new item’s key. If it’s smaller than the root’s key, insert it into the root’s left subtree, otherwise, insert it into the root’s right subtree.

                        A postfix expression is an expression in which each operator follows its operands. The advantage of this form is that there is no need to group sub-expressions in parentheses or to consider operator precedence.

                        The heap is more flexible than the stack. That’s because memory space for the heap can be dynamically allocated and de-allocated as needed. However, the memory of the heap can at times be slower when compared to that stack.

                        The amount of memory to be allocated or reserved would depend on the data type of the variable being declared. For example, if a variable is declared to be of integer type, then 32 bits of memory storage will be reserved for that variable.

                        Most declarations do, with the exemption of pointers. Pointer declaration does not allocate memory for data, but for the address of the pointer variable. Actual memory allocation for the data comes during run-time.

        <h1>Top 5 Things to Remember in an Interview</h1>
        <p>You worked hard on your resume and job application, and now you are called in for an in-person job interview. You are one step closer to your dream job.

            It’s time to understand how to succeed in the job interview, so that you can actually land the job. Here are the most important things you have to remember.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="faq">
                    <h1>1. Dress appropriately</h1>

                    <h6>Plan out an outfit that fits the culture of the company you are applying for. If the company does not have a dress code, it’s a good idea to wear business casual.
                        
                        Leave your shorts and tank top at home, and put on a shirt and a pair of long pants. It’s always better to be overdressed than under. Try on your outfit before the interview to make sure that it fits and looks smart.
                    </h6>   
                    <h1>2. Arrive on time </h1>
                    <h6>Don’t ever arrive at a job interview late! It’s best to arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled time in case you have to fill in some paperwork. This also allows you to settle down and check out the dynamics of the office.
                        
                        If you are not familiar with the area in which the company is located, do a test run a week or two before to make sure that you won’t get lost. If you are driving, make a note on where you can park your car.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>3. Mind your manner</h1>
                    <h6>Be polite and greet everyone you meet, including people you meet in the elevator. When you enter the interview, offer the interviewer a warm greeting. These first few seconds can make or break your interview. At the end of the interview, don’t forget to thank the interviewer for giving you the opportunity for the meeting. When you leave the company, say goodbye to the receptionist.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>4. Pay attention to your body language<h1>
                    <h6>    Poor body language, such as playing with a pen, chewing gum, slouching, and even brushing back hair, can be a distraction. If you notice you have a tendency to do any of these, train yourself to avoid these bad habits. You can replace them with positive body language that include nodding, eye contact, smiling, and solid posture.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>5. Ask insightful questions</h1>
                    <h6>Most interviewers end an interview by allowing the candidate to ask questions. Regardless of how well you know the company and how thorough the interviewer in telling you about the job, you must ask a few questions. The more insightful your questions are, the more you will impress your interviewer.
