                Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program. JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code. JVM is the specification which must be implemented in the computer system. The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine independent and close to the native code.

                    Just-In-Time(JIT)compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.

                        In Java, if we make the abstract methods static, It will become the part of the class, and we can directly call it which is unnecessary. Calling an undefined method is completely useless therefore it is not allowed.

                        It is because the static method is the part of the class, and it is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with the object, and static gets memory in class area, and instance gets memory in a heap.

                        Composition, and Aggregation help to build (Has - A - Relationship) between classes and objects. But both are not the same in the end. Let’s understand with the help of an example.  

Consider the University as a class that has some departments in it. So the university will be the container object. And departments in it will contain objects. Now in this case, if the container object destroys then the contained objects will also get destroyed automatically.  So here we can say that there is a strong association between the objects. So this Strong Association is called Composition. 

Now consider one more example. Suppose we have a class department and there are several professors' objects there in the department. Now if the department class is destroyed then the professor's object will become free to bind with other objects. Because container objects (Department) only hold the references of contained objects (Professor’s). So here is the weak association between the objects. And this weak association is called Aggregation.

                        Reflection is a runtime API for inspecting and changing the behavior of methods, classes, and interfaces. Java Reflection is a powerful tool that can be really beneficial. Java Reflection allows you to analyze classes, interfaces, fields, and methods during runtime without knowing what they are called at compile time. Reflection can also be used to create new objects, call methods, and get/set field values. External, user-defined classes can be used by creating instances of extensibility objects with their fully-qualified names. Debuggers can also use reflection to examine private members of classes.

                    <p>JIT stands for Just-In-Time compiler in Java. It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions that are sent directly to the processor. By default, the JIT compiler is enabled in Java and is activated whenever a Java method is invoked. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecode of the invoked method into native machine code, compiling it “just in time” to execute. Once the method has been compiled, the JVM summons the compiled code of that method directly rather than interpreting it. This is why it is often responsible for the performance optimization of Java applications at the run time.

                    <p>An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

                    <p>Double Brace Initialization is a Java term that refers to the combination of two independent processes. 
                        <br>There are two braces used in this. 
                        <br>• The first brace creates an anonymous inner class. 
                        <br>• The second brace is an initialization block. When these both are used together, it is known as Double Brace Initialisation. The inner class has a reference to the enclosing outer class, genertally using the ‘this’ pointer. It is used to do both creation and initialization in a single statement. It is generally used to initialize collections. It reduces the code and also makes it more readable.

                    <p>In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool. Since String literals are usually shared between multiple clients, action from one client might affect the rest. It enhances security, caching, synchronization, and performance of the application.

                    <p>An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.

                        Stack is generally used to store the order of method execution and local variables. In contrast, Heap memory is used to store the objects. After storing, they use dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

                        A session is essentially defined as the random conversation's dynamic state between the client and the server. The virtual communication channel includes a string of responses and requests from both sides. The popular way of implementing session management is establishing a session ID in the client's communicative discourse and the server.

        <h1>Top 5 Things to Remember in an Interview</h1>
        <p>You worked hard on your resume and job application, and now you are called in for an in-person job interview. You are one step closer to your dream job.

            It’s time to understand how to succeed in the job interview, so that you can actually land the job. Here are the most important things you have to remember.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="faq">
                    <h1>1. Dress appropriately</h1>

                    <h6>Plan out an outfit that fits the culture of the company you are applying for. If the company does not have a dress code, it’s a good idea to wear business casual.
                        
                        Leave your shorts and tank top at home, and put on a shirt and a pair of long pants. It’s always better to be overdressed than under. Try on your outfit before the interview to make sure that it fits and looks smart.
                    </h6>   
                    <h1>2. Arrive on time </h1>
                    <h6>Don’t ever arrive at a job interview late! It’s best to arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled time in case you have to fill in some paperwork. This also allows you to settle down and check out the dynamics of the office.
                        
                        If you are not familiar with the area in which the company is located, do a test run a week or two before to make sure that you won’t get lost. If you are driving, make a note on where you can park your car.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>3. Mind your manner</h1>
                    <h6>Be polite and greet everyone you meet, including people you meet in the elevator. When you enter the interview, offer the interviewer a warm greeting. These first few seconds can make or break your interview. At the end of the interview, don’t forget to thank the interviewer for giving you the opportunity for the meeting. When you leave the company, say goodbye to the receptionist.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>4. Pay attention to your body language<h1>
                    <h6>    Poor body language, such as playing with a pen, chewing gum, slouching, and even brushing back hair, can be a distraction. If you notice you have a tendency to do any of these, train yourself to avoid these bad habits. You can replace them with positive body language that include nodding, eye contact, smiling, and solid posture.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>5. Ask insightful questions</h1>
                    <h6>Most interviewers end an interview by allowing the candidate to ask questions. Regardless of how well you know the company and how thorough the interviewer in telling you about the job, you must ask a few questions. The more insightful your questions are, the more you will impress your interviewer.
