                If a function is inline, the compiler places a copy of the code of that function at each point where the function is called at compile time. One of the important advantages of using an inline function is that it eliminates the function calling overhead of a traditional function.

                        No destructor overloading is not possible. Destructors take no arguments, so there’s only one way to destroy an object. That’s the reason destructor overloading is not possible.

                        new() is a preprocessor while malloc() is a function. 

There is no need to allocate the memory while using "new" but in malloc() you have to use sizeof(). 

"new" initializes the new memory to 0 while malloc() gives random value in the newly allotted memory location. 

The new() operator allocates the memory and calls the constructor for the object initialization and malloc() function allocates the memory but does not call the constructor for the object initialization. 

The new() operator is faster than the malloc() function as operator is faster than the function.

                        Class is a blueprint of a project or problem to be solved and consists of variables and methods. These are called the members of the class. We cannot access methods or variables of the class on its own unless they are declared static.
In order to access the class members and put them to use, we should create an instance of a class which is called an Object. The class has an unlimited lifetime whereas an object has a limited lifespan only.

                        Inline function is a function that is compiled by the compiler as the point of calling the function and the code is substituted at that point. This makes compiling faster. This function is defined by prefixing the function prototype with the keyword “inline”.
                        <br>Such functions are advantageous only when the code of the inline function is small and simple. Although a function is defined as Inline, it is completely compiler dependent to evaluate it as inline or not.

                        In C++, equal to (==) and assignment operator (=) are two completely different operators.
Equal to (==) is an equality relational operator that evaluates two expressions to see if they are equal and returns true if they are equal and false if they are not.
<br>The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Hence, we can have a complex assignment operation inside the equality relational operator for evaluation.

                        Though both codes will generate the same output, sample code 2 is a more performant option. This is due to the fact that the post-increment ‘itr++’ operator is more expensive than the pre-increment ‘++itr’ operator.

                        The post-increment operator generates a copy of the element before proceeding with incrementing the element and returning the copy. Moreover, most compilers will automatically optimize sample code 1 by converting it implicitly into sample code 2.

                        Even though it is possible to call an inline function from within itself in C++, the compiler may not generate the inline code. This is so because the compiler won’t determine the depth of the recursion at the compile time.

                        Nonetheless, a compiler with a good optimizer is able to inline recursive calls until some depth is fixed at compile-time and insert non-recursive calls at compile time for the cases when the actual depth exceeds run time.

                        Assignment operator in C++ is used to assign a value to another variable.

                        a = 5;
                        
                        This line of code assigns the integer value 5 to variable a.
                        
                        The part at the left of the =operator is known as an lvalue (left value) and the right as rvalue (right value). Lvalue must always be a variable whereas the right side can be a constant, a variable, the result of an operation or any combination of them.
                        
                        The assignment operation always takes place from the right to left and never at the inverse.
                        
                        One property which C++ has over the other programming languages is that the assignment operator can be used as the rvalue (or part of an rvalue) for another assignment.

                        You can define a friend function as a function that can access private, public and protect members of the class. You declare the friend function with the help of the friend keyword. You declare this function inside the class.

                        In the call by value method, you pass the copies of actual parameters to the function's formal parameters. This means if there is any change in the values inside the function, then that change will not affect the actual values.

                        In the call-by-reference method, the reference or address of actual parameters is sent to the function's formal parameters. This means any change in values inside the function will be reflected in the actual values.

                        You use the void() return type when you don’t want to return any value. It specifies that the function doesn’t return a value. A function with a void return type completes its task and then returns the control to the caller.

                        Yes, you can compile a program without the main function, but you cannot run or execute the program because the main() function is the entry point, from where all the execution begins. And without the entry point, then you can execute the program.

                        In prefix (++i), first, it increments the value, and then it assigns the value to the expression.

                        <br>  In postfix (i++), it assigns the value to the expression, and then it increments the variable's value.

                        A class template is used to create a family of classes and functions. For example, we can create a template of an array class which will enable us to create an array of various types such as int, float, char, etc. 
                    <br> Similarly, we can create a template for a function, suppose we have a function add(), then we can create multiple versions of add().

        <h1>Top 5 Things to Remember in an Interview</h1>
        <p>You worked hard on your resume and job application, and now you are called in for an in-person job interview. You are one step closer to your dream job.

            It’s time to understand how to succeed in the job interview, so that you can actually land the job. Here are the most important things you have to remember.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="faq">
                    <h1>1. Dress appropriately</h1>

                    <h6>Plan out an outfit that fits the culture of the company you are applying for. If the company does not have a dress code, it’s a good idea to wear business casual.
                        
                        Leave your shorts and tank top at home, and put on a shirt and a pair of long pants. It’s always better to be overdressed than under. Try on your outfit before the interview to make sure that it fits and looks smart.
                    </h6>   
                    <h1>2. Arrive on time </h1>
                    <h6>Don’t ever arrive at a job interview late! It’s best to arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled time in case you have to fill in some paperwork. This also allows you to settle down and check out the dynamics of the office.
                        
                        If you are not familiar with the area in which the company is located, do a test run a week or two before to make sure that you won’t get lost. If you are driving, make a note on where you can park your car.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>3. Mind your manner</h1>
                    <h6>Be polite and greet everyone you meet, including people you meet in the elevator. When you enter the interview, offer the interviewer a warm greeting. These first few seconds can make or break your interview. At the end of the interview, don’t forget to thank the interviewer for giving you the opportunity for the meeting. When you leave the company, say goodbye to the receptionist.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>4. Pay attention to your body language<h1>
                    <h6>    Poor body language, such as playing with a pen, chewing gum, slouching, and even brushing back hair, can be a distraction. If you notice you have a tendency to do any of these, train yourself to avoid these bad habits. You can replace them with positive body language that include nodding, eye contact, smiling, and solid posture.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>5. Ask insightful questions</h1>
                    <h6>Most interviewers end an interview by allowing the candidate to ask questions. Regardless of how well you know the company and how thorough the interviewer in telling you about the job, you must ask a few questions. The more insightful your questions are, the more you will impress your interviewer.
