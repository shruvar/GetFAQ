                Relational Database Management System(RDBMS) is based on a relational model of data that is stored in databases in separate tables and they are related to the use of a common column. Data can be accessed easily from the relational database using Structured Query Language (SQL).

                        Normalization is the process of removing redundant data from the database by splitting the table in a well-defined manner in order to maintain data integrity. This process saves much of the storage space.
                        <br>De-normalization is the process of adding up redundant data on the table in order to speed up the complex queries and thus achieve better performance.

                   <br> They can be defined as:
                   <br>•	Data Definition Language (DDL) commands are used to define the structure that holds the data. These commands are auto-committed i.e. changes done by the DDL commands on the database are saved permanently.

                   <br>•	Data Control Language (DCL) commands are used to control the visibility of the data in the database like revoke access permission for using data in the database.

                        Data abstraction in DBMS is a process of hiding irrelevant details from users. Because database systems are made of complex data structures so, it makes accessible the user interaction with the database.
<br>For example: We know that most of the users prefer those systems which have a simple GUI that means no complex processing. So, to keep the user tuned and for making the access to the data easy, it is necessary to do data abstraction. In addition to it, data abstraction divides the system in different layers to make the work specified and well defined.

                        Following are three levels of data abstraction:
                       <br>• Physical level: It is the lowest level of abstraction. It describes how data are stored.
                       <br>• Logical level: It is the next higher level of abstraction. It describes what data are stored in the database and what the relationship among those data is.
                       <br>• View level: It is the highest level of data abstraction. It describes only part of the entire database.
                       <br> For example- User interacts with the system using the GUI and fill the required details, but the user doesn't have any idea how the data is being used. So, the abstraction level is entirely high in VIEW LEVEL.
                        Then, the next level is for PROGRAMMERS as in this level the fields and records are visible and the programmers have the knowledge of this layer. So, the level of abstraction here is a little low in VIEW LEVEL.
                        And lastly, physical level in which storage blocks are described.

                        Relational Algebra is a Procedural Query Language which contains a set of operations that take one or two relations as input and produce a new relationship. Relational algebra is the basic set of operations for the relational model. The decisive point of relational algebra is that it is similar to the algebra which operates on the number.
                       <br> There are few fundamental operations of relational algebra:
                       <br> •	select
                       <br> •	project
                       <br> •	set difference
                       <br> •	union
                       <br> •	rename, etc.

                        Relational Calculus is a Non-procedural Query Language which uses mathematical predicate calculus instead of algebra. Relational calculus doesn't work on mathematics fundamentals such as algebra, differential, integration, etc. That's why it is also known as predicate calculus.
<br>There is two type of relational calculus:
<br>•	Tuple relational calculus
<br>•	Domain relational calculus

                        Once the DBMS informs the user that a transaction has completed successfully, its effect should persist even if the system crashes before all its changes are reflected on disk. This property is called durability. Durability ensures that once the transaction is committed into the database, it will be stored in the non-volatile memory and after that system failure cannot affect that data anymore.

                        Normalization is a process of analysing the given relation schemas according to their functional dependencies. It is used to minimize redundancy and also used to minimize insertion, deletion and update distractions. Normalization is considered as an essential process as it is used to avoid data redundancy, insertion anomaly, updation anomaly, deletion anomaly.
<br>There most commonly used normal forms are:
<br>•	First Normal Form(1NF)
<br>•	Second Normal Form(2NF)
<br>•	Third Normal Form(3NF)
<br>•	Boyce & Codd Normal Form(BCNF)

This reduces the time gap between query and compiling as the data has been pre-compiled and stored in the procedure. Procedures may or may not return values.

                        Black Box Testing is a software testing approach that involves testing the functions of software applications without knowing the internal code structure, implementation details, or internal routes. Black Box Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the input and output of software applications and is totally driven by software requirements and specifications. Behavioral testing is another name for it.

                        A self-join is a type of join that can be used to connect two tables. As a result, it is a unary relationship. Each row of the table is attached to itself and all other rows of the same table in a self-join. As a result, a self-join is mostly used to combine and compare rows from the same database table.

                        A SELECT command gets zero or more rows from one or more database tables or views. The most frequent data manipulation language (DML) command is SELECT in most applications. SELECT queries define a result set, but not how to calculate it, because SQL is a declarative programming language.

        <h1>Top 5 Things to Remember in an Interview</h1>
        <p>You worked hard on your resume and job application, and now you are called in for an in-person job interview. You are one step closer to your dream job.

            It’s time to understand how to succeed in the job interview, so that you can actually land the job. Here are the most important things you have to remember.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="faq">
                    <h1>1. Dress appropriately</h1>

                    <h6>Plan out an outfit that fits the culture of the company you are applying for. If the company does not have a dress code, it’s a good idea to wear business casual.
                        
                        Leave your shorts and tank top at home, and put on a shirt and a pair of long pants. It’s always better to be overdressed than under. Try on your outfit before the interview to make sure that it fits and looks smart.
                    </h6>   
                    <h1>2. Arrive on time </h1>
                    <h6>Don’t ever arrive at a job interview late! It’s best to arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled time in case you have to fill in some paperwork. This also allows you to settle down and check out the dynamics of the office.
                        
                        If you are not familiar with the area in which the company is located, do a test run a week or two before to make sure that you won’t get lost. If you are driving, make a note on where you can park your car.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>3. Mind your manner</h1>
                    <h6>Be polite and greet everyone you meet, including people you meet in the elevator. When you enter the interview, offer the interviewer a warm greeting. These first few seconds can make or break your interview. At the end of the interview, don’t forget to thank the interviewer for giving you the opportunity for the meeting. When you leave the company, say goodbye to the receptionist.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>4. Pay attention to your body language<h1>
                    <h6>    Poor body language, such as playing with a pen, chewing gum, slouching, and even brushing back hair, can be a distraction. If you notice you have a tendency to do any of these, train yourself to avoid these bad habits. You can replace them with positive body language that include nodding, eye contact, smiling, and solid posture.
                    </h6>    
                    <h1>5. Ask insightful questions</h1>
                    <h6>Most interviewers end an interview by allowing the candidate to ask questions. Regardless of how well you know the company and how thorough the interviewer in telling you about the job, you must ask a few questions. The more insightful your questions are, the more you will impress your interviewer.
